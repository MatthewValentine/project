`prototype/example.txt` makes sense to me and looks pretty simple and clear.
I like the syntax, but I'm not certain for what it would be good.
I guess flexible class definitions are pretty cool,
but no immediate usecase comes to mind.
It reminds me of functional vs. OO programming,
but it's sort of a new, more flexible paradigm
because you can separate by any member of the class (not just functions).
