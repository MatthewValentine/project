I really like your idea of how to do this sort of thing, but I'm getting a little lost about where your DSL fits in. Since I haven't tried to do something like this in Python before, I'm not sure what parts your DSL makes easier and how things would look without it. I think everything you have written basically makes sense to me since we talked about it yesterday, but it looks like there are still "hacks" and boiler plate that you're still trying to avoid.

The things at the bottom with the Transforms are really cool, though.
